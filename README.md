## CS 648 Assignment 2

### Overview
Assignment 2 was creating multiple web pages for Vecta Corp.[^v] using HTML5.

### Assignment Details
1.	The starting index.html page has already been created for you. Within the page I have added some inline styles to the <body> tag to set the margin and default width of the page. Donâ€™t touch this. This code will essentially center your design within the page. You will add your structure within the <body> element.
2.	You will create three additional web pages based on the index.html file:
    - About page (aboutus.html)
    - Solutions page (solutions.html)
    - Contact page (contactus.html)
3.	Pay close attention to the formatting on each page. I want you to duplicate the semantic structure and semantic text-level markup as you see it. If I have an item bolded, and you fail to bold it, I will deduct points. If I have an item italicized and you fail to italicize it, I will deduct points, and so on.
4.	All headings should use the `<h2>` element.

[^v]: Vecta Corp is a made up entity that the web page is built around. ***NOT A REAL COMPANY***
